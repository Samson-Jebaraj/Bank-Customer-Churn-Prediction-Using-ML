Datasource
Bank Customer Churn (https://github.com/YBI-Foundation/Dataset/raw/main/Bank%20Churn%20Modelling.csv)
13 columns, 10,000 rows

## Explaination

In order to create a model these are the following procedure:-

1) Split the dataset in 70% of Train set and 30% of Test Set.

2) Check the accuracy score for both Training and Test Set.

3) Compare the accuracies for both Training and Test set, in order to check for the overfitting issues.

## Conclusion

Machine Learning Models with their Accuracy:

1) Logistic Regression ---> 0.69

2) K Neighbors Classifier ---> 0.79

3) Random Forest Classifier ---> 0.88

So, The Random Forest Classifier Model works better when compared to other models.
